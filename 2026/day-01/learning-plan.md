Hello,I'm Priyanka 3rd year btech cse student exploring DevOps.

**My understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering:**

When I first discover this terminology I only know **DevOps** means Development + Operations and tools. After exploring more I understand that DevOps is not a tool or a job title - it is a culture and a mindset.

**DevOps: Observe->Measure->Decide**

In simple terms DevOps focuses on how software is built, tested, deployed, maintained, improved continuously.

**Cloud** is the platform that makes DevOps practical and scalable.
Cloud means:
- Servers, storage, networking available on demand
- No physical Hardware to manage
- Pay-as-yoy-go model
- Global, scalable and reliable infrasturcture

**Cloud is not DevOps but it supports DevOps**

**Why I'm starting learning devOps?**

I'm starting this journey intentionally, not casually.
My reasons are clear:
- I never found computers interesting, terminologies like server, system, process, operation system, etc. felt like just some random words.
- I always wanted to understand the system to its depth, how things work inside. That's when I discovered linux and get it replaced to windows. It was the best decision to switch on linux.
- I want skills that are industry relevant, practical and future-proof.
- I never like tutorials so couldn't complete the web development course which i bought earlier. I found them overwhelming and boring. Always wanted to build skills by doing and not just watching endless tutorials.

**I'm learning devOps bcz it builds:**
- Strong fundamentals
- Encourages responsibility and ownership
- aligns modern engineering culture
- **Most important it aligns with my personality-it's about culture and mindset first, and tools later.**

**Where I want to reach in 90 Days?**
After 90 days, I want to confidentally say:
 I understand how a real world application goes from code to production.
 **MY GOAL FOR 90 DAYS:-**
 - Solid Cloud fundamentals (aws)
 - 2 mini projects
 - deploy a production-grade application on kubernetes

# 3 Core devOps Skills:
- Linux troubleshooting
- Kubernetes debugging & Scripting
- CI/CD pipelines

# Weekly Time budget
# Consistency matters the most
- I will give atleast **2 hours weekly** to practice
- on weekends I devote major part of my day to devOps only (min. 4-5 hours)
